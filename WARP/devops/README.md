# DevOps Tooling for Well-Architected Recommendation Process

## Overview

There are four sections to this document:

1. Preparation
1. Reporting
1. Place findings into an Azure DevOps project
1. Importing to GitHub

## Preparation

### Download and prepare your environment for all the scripts

1. Create a directory for the import scripts to be used.

1. Right-click on this [link](https://rspott.com/WARP/install-WARP-tools.ps1) and save the installation script in the directory you created.

1. Right-click on the downloaded file, select **Properties**, then check **Unblock**.

1. Run the script file to download the rest of the required files.

1. For each `.ps1` file downloaded: right-click on the file, select **Properties**, then check **Unblock**.

1. Place the `.csv` file created through the web-assessment into the directory with the files that have been downloaded.

### Test your environment and the script

1. Right-click and run the `.\GenerateWAFReport.ps1` script.

1. Choose the saved demo WAF file:

    `Azure_Well_Architected_Review_Feb_01_2010_8_00_00_AM.csv`

1. A PowerPoint file will be created in the same directory with this name:

    `PnP\_PowerPointReport\_Template_mmm-dd-yyyy hh.mm.ss.pptx`

1. Examine this PowerPoint file for autogenerated slides after slide 8.

1. If these slides are created in this deck, then your environment is properly set up and you may move on.

## Reporting

### Create a customer presentation PowerPoint deck using PowerShell

1. Right-click and run the `.\GenerateWAFReport.ps1` script.

1. Choose the WAF file saved from the earlier assessment.

1. A PowerPoint file will be created in the same directory with this name:

    `PnP\_PowerPointReport\_Template_mm-dd-yyyy hh.mm.ss.pptx`

1. Examine this PowerPoint file for autogenerated slides after slide 8.

## Place findings into an Azure DevOps project

1. Create or log into an Azure DevOps Organization:

    - If an organization does not exist, follow these steps in this [link](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true).

1. Note the Organization URI:

    Example: `https://dev.azure.com/contoso/`

1. Go to the project used for this effort:

    - If a project does not exist in the Azure DevOps Organization, then create a new project using the steps in this [link](/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page&preserve-view=true).
    - When you create this project, ensure you select **Agile Process** under **Advanced**.

1. Note the URI created by this action:

    Example: `https://dev.azure.com/contoso/WARP-work`

1. Create or acquire a personal access token with read-write access to create DevOps work items using this [link](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page&preserve-view=true).

1. Place this token into the `keys.txt` file in the proper location.

1. Open a command prompt to your PowerShell environment and run the following command: 

    `PnP-DevOps.ps1 <url to project in Azure Devops>`

    Example: `PnP-DevOps.ps1 https://dev.azure.com/demo-org/demo-project`

    - When prompted, choose the WAF file saved from the earlier assessment.
    - The PowerShell script will present a prompt to make sure you are ready to perform the import.
    - Choose **Y** to continue.

        ```powershell
        This script is using the WAF report: Azure\_Well\_Architected\_Review mmm-dd-yyyy hh.mm.ss_AM.csv
        This script will insert data into Azure DevOps org: <orgname>
        This will insert XXX items into the <projectname> project.
        We are using the Azure DevOps token that starts with abcde
        Ready? [y/n]
        ```

1. The script will then import the items into Azure DevOps.

1. After running the script, navigate to **Backlogs** in DevOps and select the **Epics** filter on the top right to view the categorized list of items.

1. Seeing some exceptions while running the script is expected.

1. Please validate DevOps:

    - As long as **Epics** and **Features** are populated, you can proceed.

## Place findings into a GitHub repository

1. Acquire a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) with write access to create issues:

    - Permissions should be *Full control of private repositories*.

1. Add this personal access token to the `keys.txt` file as *GitHubUserToken*.

1. Add the GitHub username of the person whose token is being used to the `keys.txt` file as `$owner`.

1. Replace the `$repository` value with the GitHub repository name:

    `Example: https://github.com/contoso/WAF-repository`

    - The value would be `WAF-repository`.

1. Right-click and run the `PnP-Github.ps1` script.

1. Choose the WAF file saved from the earlier assessment:

    - Seeing some exceptions while running the script are expected.

1. Please validate GitHub:

    - You should see **Milestones** and **Issues** populated with data.

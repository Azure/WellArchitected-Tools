Cost Optimization,Understand the Azure services used and cost implications,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/cost/design-initial-estimate,High,Application Design,Application Composition,90,"It is important to understand what Azure services, such as App Services and Event Hubs, are used by the application platform to host both application code and data. In a discussion around cost, this can drive decisions towards the right replacements (e.g. moving from Virtual Machines to containers to increase efficiency, or migrating to .NET Core to use cheaper SKUs etc.)."
Cost Optimization,Organize data into access tiers,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/considerations/storage-options,High,Application Design,Application Composition,90,"Azure offers multiple products and services for different storage capabilities.  Review the different options available and decide which one is better for your workload.

Cost Optimization,Design the workload to scale independently,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/cost/optimize-autoscale,High,Capacity & Service Availability Planning,Efficiency,90,"For certain application, capacity requirements may swing over time. Autoscaling policies allow for less error-prone operations and cost savings through robust automation. Choose smaller instances where workload is highly variable and scale out to get the desired level of performance, rather than up."
Cost Optimization,Utilize the PaaS pay-as-you-go consumption model where relevant,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/cost/design-price,Medium,Operational Procedures,Operational Lifecycles,50,"To bring down cost the goal should be to get as many applications to only consume resources when they are used, this goes as an evolution from IaaS to PaaS to serverless where you only pay when a service I triggered. The PaaS and serverless might appear more expensive, but risk and other operational work is transferred to the cloud provider which should also be factored in as part of the cost (e.g. patching, monitoring, licenses)."
Cost Optimization,Use cost forecasting for budget alignment,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/quick-acm-cost-analysis?tabs=azure-portal,Medium,Governance,Financial Management & Cost Models,50,In order to predict costs and trends it's recommended to use forecasting to be proactive for any spending that might be going up due to higher demand than anticipated.
Cost Optimization,Consider selective backups for VMs,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/selective-disk-backup-restore,Medium,Application Design,Design,50,"Azure Backup supports the use of the Selective Disks backup and restore functionally which allows you to back up a subset of data disks in a VM, which is an efficient  and cost-effective way to backup your application."
Cost Optimization,Understand the cost implications of Availability Zones,https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/availability-zones/,Medium,Application Design,Design,50,"Availability Zones can be used to optimize application availability within a region by providing datacenter level fault tolerance. However, the application architecture must not share dependencies between zones to use them effectively. It is also important to note that Availability Zones may introduce performance and cost considerations for applications which are extremely 'chatty' across zones given the implied physical separation between each zone and inter-zone bandwidth charges. That also means that AZ can be considered to get higher Service Level Agreement (SLA) for lower cost. Be aware of  pricing changes coming to Availability Zone bandwidth starting February 2021."
Cost Optimization,The entire end-to-end CI/CD deployment process should be understood,https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/devops/azure-devops-services/,Medium,Deployment & Testing,Application Code Deployments,50, 
Cost Optimization,Explore where technical delivery capabilities reside,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/cost/design-model#organization-structure,Medium,Operational Model & DevOps,Roles & Responsibilities,50,Map the organization's needs to logical groupings offered by cloud services. This way the business leaders of the company get a clear view of the cloud services and how they're controlled.
Cost Optimization,Define a clear price model for individual services,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/cost/design-price,Medium,Capacity & Service Availability Planning,Efficiency,50,As part of driving a good behavior it's important that the consumer has understood why they are paying the price for a service and also that the cost is transparent and fair to the user of the service or else it can drive wrong behavior.
Cost Optimization,Pause AKS clusters,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/start-stop-cluster,Medium,Capacity & Service Availability Planning,Efficiency,50,"To optimize your costs when AKS workloads may not need to run continuously, you can completely turn off (stop) your cluster. This action will stop your control plane and agent nodes altogether, allowing you to save on all the compute costs, while maintaining all your objects and cluster state stored for when you start it again. "
Cost Optimization,Understand cost implications of hub and spoke design,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/networking/hub-spoke-vwan-architecture,Medium,Networking & Connectivity,Data flow,50,Consider using a hub and spoke approach to save costs by using a managed service and removing the necessity of network virtual appliance.
Cost Optimization,Be aware of cross-region data transfer costs,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/cost/provision-networking#peering,Medium,Networking & Connectivity,Data flow,50,Moving data between regions can add additional cost - both on the storage layer or networking layer. It's worth reviewing if this cost is can be replaced via re-architecture or justified due to e.g. disaster recovery (DR).
Cost Optimization,Understand cloud-native features and implement where possible,https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/cloudnative/,Low,Application Design,Design,10,Understanding if the application is cloud-native or not provides a very useful high-level indication about potential technical debt for operability and cost efficiency.

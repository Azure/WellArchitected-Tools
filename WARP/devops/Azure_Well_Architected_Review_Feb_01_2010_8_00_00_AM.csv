Security,Configure emergency access accounts,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/roles/security-emergency-access,High,Operational Model & DevOps,Roles & Responsibilities,100,"While rare, sometimes extreme circumstances arise where all normal means of administrative access are unavailable and for this reason emergency access accounts (also refered to as 'break glass' accounts) should be available. These accounts are strictly controlled in accordance with best practice guidance, and they are closely monitored for unsanctioned use to ensure they are not compromised or used for nefarious purposes."
Security,Implement threat protection for the workload,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/azure-defender,High,Application Design,Threat Analysis,100,"Enterprise workloads are subjected to many threats that can jeopardize confidentiality, availability, or integrity and should be protected with advanced security solutions."
Security,Implement security strategy to contain attacker access,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/resilience#containing-attacker-access,High,Application Design,Application Design,90,"The actual security risk for an organization is heavily influenced by how much access an adversary can or does obtain to valuable systems and data. For example, when each user only has a focused scope of permissions assigned to them, the impact of compromising an account will be limited."
Security,Adopt a zero trust approach,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/network-best-practices?bc=%2fazure%2farchitecture%2fbread%2ftoc.json&toc=%2fazure%2farchitecture%2ftoc.json#adopt-a-zero-trust-approach,High,Networking & Connectivity,Data flow,90,"Data exfiltration occurs when an internal/external malicious actor performs an unauthorized data transfer. The solution should leverage a layered approach such as hub/spoke for network communications with deep packet inspection to detect/protect from data exfiltration attack. Azure Firewall, UDR (User-defined Routes), NSG (Network Security Groups), Key Protection, Data Encryption, PrivateLink, and Private Endpoints are layered defenses for a data exfiltration attack. Azure Sentinel and Azure Security Center can be used to detect data exfiltration attempts and alert incident responders."
Security,Implement a branch policy strategy to enhance DevOps security,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/deploy-governance#gated-approval-process,High,Deployment & Testing,Application Code Deployments,90,"Branch policies provide additional level of control over the code which is commited to the product. It is a common practice to not allow pushing against the main branch and require pull-request (PR) with code review before merging the changes by at least one reviewer, other than the change author. Different branches can have different purposes and access levels, for example: feature branches are created by developers and are open to push, integration branch requires PR and code-review and production branch requires additional approval from a senior developer before merging."
Security,Classify your data at rest and use encryption,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-storage-encryption#data-at-rest,High,Security & Compliance,Encryption,90,"This includes all information storage objects, containers, and types that exist statically on physical media, whether magnetic or optical disk.  All data should be classified and encrypted with an encryption standard. It should also be tagged so that it can be audited."
Security,Establish a detection and response strategy for identity risks,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/monitor-identity-network#review-identity-risks,High,Health Modeling & Monitoring,Application Level Monitoring,90,"Most security incidents take place after an attacker initially gains access using a stolen identity. These identities can often start with low privileges, but attackers then use that identity to traverse laterally and gain access to more privileged identities. This repeats as needed until the attacker controls access to the ultimate target data or systems. Reported risk events for Azure AD can be viewed in Azure AD reporting, or Azure AD Identity Protection. Additionally, the Identity Protection risk events API can be used to programmatically access identity related security detections using Microsoft Graph."
Security,Adopt a formal DevSecOps approach to building and maintaining software,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/deploy,High,Operational Model & DevOps,General,90,"The DevOps approach increases the organization's ability to rapidly address security concerns without waiting for a longer planning and testing cycle of traditional waterfall model. Key attributes are: automation, close integration of infra and dev teams, testability and reliability and repeatability of deployments."
Security,Scan container workloads for vulnerabilities,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/container-security,High,Deployment & Testing,Testing & Validation,90,"Azure Security Center is the Azure-native solution for securing containers. Security Center can protect virtual machines that are running Docker, Azure Kubernetes Service clusters, Azure Container Registry registries. ASC is able to scan container images and identify security issues, or provide real-time threat detection for containerized environments."
Security,Establish a security operations center (SOC),https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/security-operations,High,Operational Procedures,Incident Response,90,"A SOC has a critical role in limiting the time and access an attacker can get to valuable systems and data.  In addition, it provides the vital role of detecting the presence of adversaries, reacting to an alert of suspicious activity, or proactively hunting for anomalous events in the enterprise activity logs."
Security,Implement Conditional Access Policies,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-identity-authentication#enable-conditional-access,High,Security & Compliance,Authentication and authorization,90,"Modern cloud-based applications are often accessible over the internet and location-based networking restrictions don't make much sense, but it needs to be mapped and understood what kind of restrictions are required. Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) is a necessity for remote access, IP-based filtering can be used to enable ad-hoc debugging, but VPNs are preferred."
Security,Implement established processes and timelines to deploy mitigations for identified threats,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-threat-model#3--mitigate-the-identified-threats,High,Application Design,Threat Analysis,90,Fixing identified vulnerabilities in a timely manner helps staying secure and preventing additional attack vectors.
Security,"Restrict access to backend services to a minimal set of public IP addresses, only those who really need it",https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-network-connectivity#communication-with-backend-services,High,Networking & Connectivity,Connectivity,90,Web applications typically have one public entrypoint and don't expose subsequent APIs and database servers over the internet. When using gateway services like Azure Front Door it's possible to restrict access only to a set of Front Door IP addresses and lock down the infrastructure completely.
Security,Protect all public endpoints with appropriate controls,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-network-endpoints#web-application-firewalls-wafs,High,Networking & Connectivity,Endpoints,90,"External application endpoints should be protected against common attack vectors, such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks like Slowloris, to prevent potential application downtime due to malicious intent. Azure-native technologies such as Azure Firewall, Application Gateway/Azure Front Door Web Application Firewall (WAF), and DDoS Protection Standard Plan can be used to achieve requisite protection."
Security,Ensure all Azure environments that connect to your production environment/network apply your organization's policy and IT governance controls for security,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/Security/governance#manage-connected-tenants,High,Health Modeling & Monitoring,Resource and Infrastructure Level Monitoring,80,Ensure the security organization is aware of all enrollments and associated subscriptions connected to the existing environment and is able to monitor those resources as part of the overall enterprise security posture.
Security,Configure quality gate approvals in DevOps release process,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/deploy-governance#gated-approval-process,High,Operational Model & DevOps,Roles & Responsibilities,70,"Pull Requests and code reviews serve as the first line of approvals during development cycle. Before releasing new code to production (new features, bugfixes etc.), security review and approval should be required."
Security,Involve the security team in the development process,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/security-governance-and-compliance#service-enablement-framework,High,Operational Model & DevOps,Roles & Responsibilities,70,"There should be a process for onboarding service securely to Azure. The onboarding process should include reviewing the configuration options to determine what logging/monitoring needs to be established, how to properly harden a resource before it goes into production."
Security,Establish a process for key management and automatic key rotation,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/secrets/tutorial-rotation-dual,High,Operational Procedures,Configuration & Secrets Management,70,"In the situation where a key or secret becomes compromised, it is important to be able to quickly act and generate new versions. Key rotation reduces the attack vectors and should be automated and executed without any human interactions."
Security,Integrate code scanning tools within CI/CD pipeline,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/deploy-code#credential-scanning,High,Deployment & Testing,Application Code Deployments,70,"Credentials should not be stored in source code or configuration files, because that increases the risk of exposure. Code analyzers (such as Roslyn analyzers for Visual Studio) can prevent from pushing credentials to source code repository and pipeline addons such as GitHub Advanced Security or CredScan (part of Microsoft Security Code Analysis) help to catch credentials during the build process."
Security,Apply security controls to self-hosted build agents in the same manner as with other Azure IaaS VMs,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/deploy-infrastructure#build-environments,High,Deployment & Testing,Build Environments,70,"When the organization uses their own build agents it adds management complexity and can become an attack vector. Build machine credentials must be stored securely and file system needs to be cleaned of any temporary build artifacts regularly. Network isolation can be achieved by only allowing outgoing traffic from the build agent, because it's using pull model of communication with Azure DevOps."
Security,Establish a unified enterprise segmentation strategy,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-network-segmentation,High,Networking & Connectivity,Connectivity,70,"A unified enterprise segmentation strategy will guide all technical teams to consistently segment access using networking, applications, identity, and any other access controls."
Security,Use service endpoints and private links where appropriate,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-network-endpoints#public-endpoints,High,Networking & Connectivity,Connectivity,70,"Service Endpoints and Private Link can be leveraged to restrict access to PaaS endpoints only from authorized virtual networks, effectively mitigating data intrusion risks and associated impact to application availability. Service Endpoints provide service level access to a PaaS service, while Private Link provides direct access to a specific PaaS resource to mitigate data exfiltration risks (e.g. malicious admin scenarios). Don't forget that Private Link is a paid service and has meters for inbound and outbound data processed. Private Endpoints are charged as well."
Security,Implement just-in-time privileged access management,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure,High,Operational Model & DevOps,Roles & Responsibilities,70,"Minimizing the number of people who have access to secure information or resources reduces the chance of a malicious actor gaining access or an authorized user inadvertently impacting a sensitive resource. For example, Azure AD Privileged Identity Management provides time-based and approval-based role activation to mitigate the risks of excessive, unnecessary, or misused access permissions on resources that you care about."
Security,Conduct periodic access reviews for the workload,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/monitor-audit#enforce-policy-compliance,High,Security & Compliance,Control-plane RBAC,70,"As people in the organization and on the project change, it is crucial to make sure that only the right people have access to the application infrastructure. Auditing and reviewing access reduces the attack vector to the application. Azure control plane depends on Azure AD and access reviews are often centrally performed often as part of internal or external audit activities. For the application specific access it is recommended to do the same at least twice a year."
Security,Use only secure hash algorithms (SHA-2 family),https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/Security/governance#discover-and-replace-insecure-protocols,High,Security & Compliance,Encryption,70,"Applications should use the SHA-2 family of hash algorithms (SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512)."
Security,Discover and remediate common risks to improve Secure Score in Azure Security Center,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/Security/governance#discover-and-remediate-common-risks,High,Security & Compliance,Security Center,70,"Identifying and remediating common security hygiene risks significantly reduces overall risk to the organization by increasing cost to attackers. Azure Secure Score in Azure Security Center monitors the security posture of machines, networks, storage and data services, and applications to discover potential security issues (internet connected VMs, or missing security updates, missing endpoint protection or encryption, deviations from baseline security configurations, missing Web Application Firewall (WAF), and more)."
Security,Protect workload publishing methods and restrict those not in use,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-network-connectivity#communication-with-backend-services,High,Networking & Connectivity,Endpoints,70,"Application resources allowing multiple methods to publish app content (e.g FTP, Web Deploy) should have the unused endpoints disabled. For Azure Web Apps SCM is the recommended endpoint and it can be protected separately with network restrictions for sensitive scenarios."
Security,Follow DevOps security guidance and automation for securing applications,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/deploy-code,High,Operational Model & DevOps,General,70,"Organizations should leverage a control framework such as NIST, CIS or Azure Security Benchmarks (ASB) for securing applications on the cloud rather than starting from zero."
Security,"Prohibit direct internet access of virtual machines with policy, logging, and monitoring",https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/Security/governance#remove-virtual-machine-vm-direct-internet-connectivity,High,Networking & Connectivity,Endpoints,70,Attackers constantly scan public cloud IP ranges for open management ports and attempt 'easy' attacks like common passwords and known unpatched vulnerabilities. Limiting internet access from within an application server can prevent data exfiltration or stop the attacker from downloading additional tools.
Security,Review and consider elevated security capabilities for Azure workloads,https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/confidential-compute/,High,Governance,Standards,70,Careful consideration is necessary on whether to utilize specialized security capabilities in the workload architecture. These capabilities include dedicated Hardware Security Modules and Confidential Computing.
Security,Clearly define CI/CD roles and permissions,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/deploy-governance#minimize-access,High,Operational Model & DevOps,Roles & Responsibilities,70,Defining CI/CD permissions properly ensures that only users responsible for production releases are able to initiate the process and that only developers can access the source code. Azure DevOps offers pre-defined roles which can be assigned to individual users of groups. Using them properly can make sure that for example only users responsible for production releases are able to initiate the process and that only developers can access the source code. Variable groups often contain sensitive configuration information and can be protected as well.
Security,Automatically remove/obfuscate personally identifiable information (PII) for this workload,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/cognitive-search-skill-pii-detection,High,Health Modeling & Monitoring,Application Level Monitoring,70,"Extra care should be taken around logging of sensitive application areas. PII (contact information, payment information etc.) should not be stored in any application logs and protective measures should be applied (such as obfuscation)."
Security,Define a set of Azure Policies which enforce organizational standards and are aligned with the governance team,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/overview,High,Security & Compliance,Compliance,70,Azure Policy should be used to enforce and report a compliant configuration of Azure services. Azure policies can be used on multiple levels. It is recommended to apply organizational wide security controls on Azure platform level. These policies build the guardrails of a landing zone.
Security,Establish security benchmarking using Azure Security Benchmark to align with industry standards,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/Security/governance#evaluate-security-using-benchmarks,High,Application Design,Threat Analysis,70,"Benchmarking  enables security program improvement by learning from external organizations. It lets the organization know how its current security state compares to that of other organizations. As an example, the Center for Internet Security (CIS) has created security benchmarks for Azure that map to the CIS Control Framework. Another reference example is the MITRE ATT&CK framework that defines the various adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations."
Security,Define security requirements for the workload,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/concepts/azure-security-benchmark-baseline,High,Application Design,Threat Analysis,70,Azure resources should be blocked that do not meet the proper security requirements defined during service enablement.
Security,"Remove platform-specific information from HTTP headers, error messages, and web site content",https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-app-dependencies#configuration-security,High,Application Design,Design,70,"Information revealing the application platform, such as HTTP banners containing framework information (""`X-Powered-By`"", ""`X-ASPNET-VERSION`""), are commonly used by malicious actors when mapping attack vectors of the application. HTTP headers, error messages, website footers etc. should not contain information about the application platform. Azure CDN or Cloudflare can be used to separate the hosting platform from end users, Azure API Management offers transformation policies that allow to modify HTTP headers and remove sensitive information."
Security,Define an access model for keys and secrets,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/secure-your-key-vault,High,Operational Procedures,Configuration & Secrets Management,70,Permissions to keys and secrets have to be controlled with an access model.
Security,"Use tools like Azure Disk Encryption, BitLocker or DM-Crypt to encrypt virtual disks",https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-storage-encryption#data-classification,High,Security & Compliance,Encryption,70,Encrypting the virtual disk files helps prevent attackers from gaining access to the contents of the disk files in the event an attacker is able to download the files and mount the disk files offline on a separate system.
Security,Deprecate legacy network security controls,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/Security/network-security-containment#discontinue-legacy-network-security-technology,High,Security & Compliance,Network Security,70,"Network-based Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is decreasingly effective at identifying both inadvertent and deliberate data loss. The reason for this is that most modern protocols and attackers use network-level encryption for inbound and outbound communications. While the organization can use 'SSL-bridging' to provide an 'authorized man-in-the-middle' that terminates and then reestablishes encrypted network connections, this can also introduce privacy, security and reliability challenges."
Security,Use Azure Firewall or a 3rd party next-generation firewall to protect against data exfiltration,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-network-flow#data-exfiltration,High,Networking & Connectivity,Connectivity,70,NVA solutions and Azure Firewall (for supported protocols) can be leveraged as a reverse proxy to restrict access to only authorized PaaS services for services where Private Link is not yet supported.
Security,Use NSG or Azure Firewall to protect and control traffic within VNETs,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-network-connectivity#connectivity-between-network-segments,High,Networking & Connectivity,Connectivity,70,"If NSGs are being used to isolate and protect the application, the rule set should be reviewed to confirm that required services are not unintentionally blocked."
Security,Use Managed Identities for authentication to other Azure platform services,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/,High,Operational Procedures,Configuration & Secrets Management,70,Managed Identities in Azure can be used to securely access Azure services while removing the need to store the secrets or certificates of Service Principals.
Security,Integrate network logs into a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM),https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/monitor-security-operations#leverage-native-detections-and-controls,High,Security & Compliance,Network Security,70,"Integrating logs from the network devices, and even raw network traffic itself, will provide greater visibility into potential security threats flowing over the wire."
Security,Data in transit should be encrypted at all points to ensure data integrity,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-storage-encryption#data-in-transit,High,Security & Compliance,Encryption,70,"When data is being transferred between components, locations, or programs, it's in transit. Data in transit should be encrypted using a common encryption standard at all points to ensure data integrity. For example: web applications and APIs should use HTTPS/SSL for all communication with clients and also between each other (in micro-services architecture). Determine if all components in the solution are using a consistent standard. There are times when encryption is not possible due to technical limitations, but the reason needs to be clear and valid."
Security,Establish an incident response plan and perform periodically a simulated execution,https://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/EN-US-CNTNT-emergency-doc-digital.pdf,High,Operational Procedures,Incident Response,70,Actions executed during an incident and response investigation could impact application availability or performance. It is recommended to define these processes and align them with the responsible (and in most cases central) SecOps team. The impact of such an investigation on the application has to be analyzed.
Security,Use penetration testing and red team exercises to validate security defenses for this workload,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/monitor-test#penetration-testing-pentesting,High,Deployment & Testing,Testing & Validation,70,"Real world validation of security defenses is critical to validate a defense strategy and implementation. Penetration tests or red team programs can be used to simulate either one time, or persistent threats against an organization to validate defenses that have been put in place to protect organizational resources."
Security,Establish a designated group responsible for central network management,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-segmentation#functions-and-teams,High,Security & Compliance,Network Security,70,"Centralizing network management and security can reduce the potential for inconsistent strategies that create potential attacker exploitable security risks. Because all divisions of the IT and development organizations do not have the same level of network management and security knowledge and sophistication, organizations benefit from leveraging a centralized network team's expertise and tooling."
Security,Build a security containment strategy,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-network-segmentation,High,Security & Compliance,Network Security,70,Assume breach is the recommended cybersecurity mindset and the ability to contain an attacker is vital to protect information systems.
Security,Evolve security beyond network controls,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/Security/network-security-containment#evolve-security-beyond-network-controls,High,Security & Compliance,Network Security,70,Traditional network controls based on a 'trusted intranet' approach will not be able to effectively provide security assurances for cloud applications.
Security,Periodically perform external and/or internal workload security audits,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/monitor-audit#review-critical-access,High,Security & Compliance,Compliance,70,"Compliance is important for several reasons. Aside from signifying levels of standards, like ISO 27001 and others, noncompliance with regulatory guidelines may bring sanctions and penalties."
Security,Develop a security plan,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/get-started/security#step-3-develop-a-security-plan,High,Application Design,Security Criteria & Data Classification,70,"A security plan should be part of the main planning documentation for the cloud. It should include several core elements including organizational functions, security skilling, technical security architecture and capabilities roadmap."
Security,"Review, prioritize, and proactively apply security best practices to cloud resources",https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/Security/governance#prioritize-security-best-practices-investments,High,Application Design,Security Criteria & Data Classification,70,Security best practices are ideally applied proactively and completely to all systems as the cloud workload is implemented.
Security,Establish lifecycle management policy for critical accounts,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-identity-authorization#authorization-for-critical-accounts,High,Security & Compliance,Separation of duties,70,A compromise of an account in a role that is assigned privileges with a business-critical impact can be detrimental to organizational information systems and should therefore be closely monitored including a lifecycle process.
Security,Designate the parties responsible for specific functions in Azure,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-identity-role-definitions,High,Operational Model & DevOps,Roles & Responsibilities,70,"Clearly documenting and sharing the contacts responsible for each of these functions will create consistency and facilitate communication. Examples of such contact groups include network security, network management, server endpoint security, incident response, policy management, identity."
Security,Implement a solution to configure unique local admin credentials,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/update-management/overview,High,Operational Procedures,Patch & Update Process (PNU),70,Attackers constantly scan public cloud IP ranges for open management ports and attempt 'easy' attacks like common passwords and unpatched vulnerabilities.
Security,Store keys and secrets outside of application code in Azure Key Vault,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-storage-keys#key-storage,High,Operational Procedures,Configuration & Secrets Management,70,"API keys, database connection strings and passwords are all sensitive to leakage, occasionally require rotation and are prone to expiration. Storing them in a secure store and not within the application code or configuration simplifies operational tasks like key rotation as well as improving overall security."
Security,Mitigate DDoS attacks,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-network-endpoints#mitigate-ddos-attacks,High,Networking & Connectivity,Endpoints,70,"DDoS attacks can be very debilitating and completely block access to your services or even take down the services, depending on the type of DDoS attack."
Security,Standardize on modern authentication protocols,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-identity-authentication#use-modern-password-protection,High,Security & Compliance,Authentication and authorization,70,Modern authentication protocols support strong controls such as Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) and should be used instead of legacy.
Security,Implement lifecycle management process for SSL/TLS certificates,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/certificates/tutorial-rotate-certificates,High,Operational Procedures,Configuration & Secrets Management,70,Expired SSL/TLS certificates are one of the most common yet avoidable causes of application outages; even Azure and more recently Microsoft Teams have experienced outages due to expired certificates.
Security,Maintain a list of frameworks and libraries as part of the application inventory,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-app-dependencies#dependencies-frameworks-and-libraries,Medium,Application Design,Dependencies,60,"As part of the workload inventory the application team should maintain a framework and library list, along with versions in use. Understanding of the frameworks and libraries (custom, OSS, 3rd party, etc.) used by the application and the resulting vulnerabilities is important."
Security,Configure web apps to reuse authentication tokens securely and handle them like other credentials,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-acquire-cache-tokens,Medium,Security & Compliance,Authentication and authorization,60,"OAuth tokens are usually cached after they've been acquired. Application code should first try to get tokens silently from a cache before attempting to acquire a token from the identity provider, to optimize performance and maximize availability. Tokens should be stored securely and handled as any other credentials. When there's a need to share tokens across application servers (instead of each server acquiring and caching their own) encryption should be used."
Security,Ensure security team has Security Reader or equivalent to support all cloud resources in their purview,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/Security/governance#security-team-visibility,Medium,Security & Compliance,Control-plane RBAC,60,"Provide security teams read-only access to the security aspects of all technical resources in their purview. Security organizations require visibility into the technical environment to perform their duties of assessing and reporting on organizational risk. Without this visibility, security will have to rely on information provided from groups, operating the environment, who have a potential conflict of interest (and other priorities). Note that security teams may separately be granted additional privileges if they have operational responsibilities or a requirement to enforce compliance on Azure resources. For example in Azure, assign security teams to the Security Readers permission that provides access to measure security risk (without providing access to the data itself). Because security will have broad access to the environment (and visibility into potentially exploitable vulnerabilities), you should consider them critical impact accounts and apply the same protections as administrators."
Security,Implement security playbooks for incident response,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/workflow-automation,Medium,Operational Procedures,Incident Response,60,Incident responders are part of a central SecOps team and need to understand security insights of an application. Playbooks can help to understand the security concepts and cover the typical investigation activities. These procedures can and should be automated as much as possible (while maintaining confidence and security).
Security,Synchronize on-premises directory with Azure AD,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-identity-authentication#centralize-all-identity-systems,Medium,Security & Compliance,Authentication and authorization,60,Consistency of identities across cloud and on-premises will reduce human errors and resulting security risk. Teams managing resources in both environments need a consistent authoritative source to achieve security assurances.
Security,Implement identity-based storage access controls,https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/design-storage-encryption#azure-encryption-features,Medium,Security & Compliance,Encryption,60,"Protecting data at rest is required to maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability assurances across all workloads.

Pillar,Category,Description
Cost Optimization,Architecture Design,"Break down high-level goals into functional requirements. For each of those requirements, define metrics to calculate cost estimates accurately. Cloud services are priced based on performance, features, and locations. When defining these metrics, identify acceptable boundaries of performance, scale, resilience, and security. Start by expressing your goals in number of business transactions over time, breaking them down to fine-grain requirements."
Cost Optimization,Capacity & Service Availability Planning,
Cost Optimization,Cost Model,Cost modeling is an exercise where you create logical groups of cloud resources that are mapped to the organization's hierarchy and then estimate costs for those groups. The goal of cost modeling is to estimate the overall cost of the organization in the cloud.
Cost Optimization,Governance,Governance can assist with cost management. This work will benefit your ongoing cost review process and will offer a level of protection for new resources.
Cost Optimization,Health Modeling & Monitoring,
Cost Optimization,Monitor,"The goal of cost monitoring is to review cloud spend with the intent of establishing cost controls and preventing any misuse. The organization should adopt both proactive and reactive review approaches for monitoring cost. Effective cost reviews must be conducted by accountable stakeholders at a regular cadence. The reviews must be complemented with reactive cost reviews, for example when a budget limit causes an alert."
Cost Optimization,Networking & Connectivity,
Cost Optimization,Operational Model & DevOps,

Understanding your strategic direction, people organization, and governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) needs can help define your future state cloud operating model."
Operational Excellence,Operational Procedures,Operational Procedures allows your application running in the Cloud as crucial. These procedures allows to monitor and diagnose application performance and issues on the Cloud.
Operational Excellence,Survey Level Group,The operational excellence pillar covers the operations processes that keep an application running in production. Deployments must be reliable and predictable. Automated deployments reduce the chance of human error. Fast and routine deployment processes won't slow down the release of new features or bug fixes.
Performance Efficiency,Application Design,"Application design is critical to handling scale as load increases. It involves choosing the right data storage, database considerations, VM sizing, building with microservices and establishing connection pooling."
Performance Efficiency,Application Performance Management,
Performance Efficiency,Capacity & Service Availability Planning,
Performance Efficiency,Capacity Planning,"Plan for fluctuation in expected load that can occur because of world events. Test variations of load before the events, including unexpected ones, to ensure that your application can scale. Make sure all regions can adequately scale to support total load, if a region fail."
Performance Efficiency,Health Modeling & Monitoring,
Performance Efficiency,Monitoring,"Troubleshooting an application's performance requires monitoring and reliable investigation. Issues in performance can arise from database queries, connectivity between services, under-provision resources, or memory leaks in code. Continuously monitoring services and checking the health state of current workloads is key in maintaining the overall performance of the workload."
Performance Efficiency,Networking & Connectivity,
Performance Efficiency,Performance Testing,"Performance testing helps to maintain systems properly and fix defects before problems reach system users. It helps maintain the efficiency, responsiveness, scalability, and speed of applications when compared with business requirements. "
Performance Efficiency,Survey Level Group,"Performance efficiency is the ability of your workload to scale to meet the demands placed on it by users in an efficient manner. Just as you needed to anticipate increases in load in on-premises environments, you need to anticipate increases in cloud environments to meet business requirements."
Performance Efficiency,Troubleshooting,"Issues in performance can arise from database queries, connectivity between services, under-provision resources, or memory leaks in code. Application telemetry and profiling can be useful tools for troubleshooting your application."
Reliability,Application Design,"Building a reliable application in the cloud is different from traditional application development. Instead of trying to prevent failures altogether, the goal is to minimize the effects of a single failing component."
Reliability,Application Performance Management,
Reliability,Application Platform Availability,
Reliability,Capacity & Service Availability Planning,
Reliability,Data Platform Availability,
Reliability,Deployment & Testing,
Reliability,Health Modeling & Monitoring,The health model should be able to surface the health of critical system flows or key subsystems to ensure appropriate operational prioritization is applied.
Reliability,Networking & Connectivity,
Reliability,Operational Procedures,
Reliability,Resiliency & Recovery,Building failure recovery into the system should be part of the architecture and design phases from the beginning to avoid the risk of failure. Dependencies are required for the application to fully operate.
Reliability,Scalability & Performance,
Reliability,Security & Compliance,
Reliability,Site Reliability Engineering & DevOps,
Reliability,Survey Level Group,Reliability ensures your application can meet the commitments you make to your customers. Architecting resiliency into your application framework ensures your workloads are available and can recover from failures at any scale.
Security,Application Design,"Application design for security is critical to ensuring confidentiality, availability, and integrity of cloud workloads. Designing an application requires putting in place security concepts and procedures within application code, application services, and the application hosting platform."
Security,Deployment & Testing,"Deployment & Testing for Azure workloads allows to quickly provision dev/test and pre-production environments to deliver secure products, applications, and services. This model defines a set of practices that combine software development and IT operations, to shorten the development cycle and provide continuous delivery with high quality and strong security controls."
Security,Governance,"Governance methodology, processes, and policies define how Azure workloads are secured, administered, monitored, audited, and reported on. Governance sets organizational policies for operations, technologies, and configurations based on internal factors (business requirements, risks, assets) and external factors (benchmarks, regulatory, threat models)."
Security,Health Modeling & Monitoring,"Health Modeling & Monitoring allows to define, capture, and analyze workload application security metrics to gain insights to workload security events so appropriate action can take place. Understanding the security of your workload should be repeatable and easily digestible by all teams."
Security,Identity & Access Control,"Identity management provides security assurance through the process of authenticating and authorizing?security principals. Identity management services authenticate and grant permission to users, partners, customers, applications, services, and other entities. In addition, a zero-trust approach provides the ability to perform risk-based access control. "
Security,Networking & Connectivity,"Network security considerations include strong network controls, logically segmentation, zero-trust approach, optimal routing, virtual appliance use, perimeter networks, dedicated WAN links, optimal uptime, disabling external access for common protocols, and securing critical Azure services to only required networks."

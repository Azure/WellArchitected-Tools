However, the application architecture must not share dependencies between zones to use them effectively. It is also important to note that Availability Zones may introduce performance and cost considerations for applications which are extremely 'chatty' across zones given the implied physical separation between each zone and inter-zone bandwidth charges. That also means that AZ can be considered to get higher Service Level Agreement (SLA) for lower cost. Be aware of  pricing changes coming to Availability Zone bandwidth starting February 2021."

To move as far as you can up the stack towards cloud-native. When the workload is serverless, it's charged only for actual use, whereas with traditional infrastructure there are many underlying things that need to be factored into the price. By applying an end date to the application it encourages you to discuss the goal of re-designing the application to make even better use of the cloud. It might be more expensive from an Azure cost point of view but factoring in other things like licenses, people, time to deploy can drive down cost."
